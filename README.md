# Virtual Pet Simulator

Welcome to the **Virtual Pet Simulator**, where users can take care of a virtual pet by feeding, playing, and letting it sleep. The pet can express different emotions, and the player must maintain its happiness, hunger, and energy levels. The simulator allows users to select from three different pets (Cat, Dog, Duck) and interact with them in a calming environment.

## Features
- Choose between a **Cat**, **Dog**, or **Duck** as your pet.
- The pet expresses different emotions: **Happy**, **Sad**, **Hungry**, and **Sleepy**.
- Keep the pet happy by feeding, playing, and letting it rest.
- Enjoy an immersive environment with a calming **video** or **GIF background**.

## How to Play
1. **Start the Game:**
   - On the landing page, click the "Play" button.
   
2. **Select Your Pet:**
   - After clicking "Play," you will be prompted to name your pet and choose between a Cat, Dog, or Duck.

3. **Interact with Your Pet:**
   - Once the game starts, you'll see your pet with its current emotional state. You can:
     - **Feed** the pet to decrease its hunger.
     - **Play** with the pet to increase happiness but reduce energy.
     - **Let the pet sleep** to restore energy.
   - Keep the pet's attributes balanced, or it will become sad, hungry, or sleepy!
